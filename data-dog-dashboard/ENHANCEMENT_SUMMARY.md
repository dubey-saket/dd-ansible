# Enhancement Summary - Modular Deployment & Teams Integration

## üéØ Enhancements Delivered

Based on your requirements, I've enhanced the Datadog monitoring solution with the following features:

### ‚úÖ 1. Modular Deployment Support

You can now deploy components individually based on your needs:

#### **Option A: Full Deployment (Dashboards + Alerts)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```
- Deploys complete monitoring solution
- Includes all dashboards and alerts
- Best for first-time deployment

#### **Option B: Dashboards Only**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-dashboards.sh
```
- Deploys only monitoring dashboards
- No alerting rules created
- Perfect for evaluation or when you have existing alerts

#### **Option C: Alerts Only**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-alerts.sh
```
- Deploys only alerting rules
- No dashboards created
- Great for adding alerts to existing dashboard setup

### ‚úÖ 2. Microsoft Teams Integration

Since you don't have Slack but have Teams configured, I've added comprehensive Teams support:

#### **Teams Webhook Integration**
```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  teams = "#alerts"  # Your Teams channel
}
```

#### **Teams Power Automate Integration**
```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  teams_power_automation = "https://your-power-automate-url.com/alerts"
}
```

#### **Custom Webhook to Teams**
```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  webhook = "https://your-custom-webhook-url.com/alerts"
}
```

## üöÄ How to Use the Enhanced Solution

### **Step 1: Choose Your Deployment Option**

#### For Dashboards Only (No Teams needed):
```bash
# Configure basic settings
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars (no notification channels needed)

# Deploy dashboards only
./scripts/deploy-dashboards.sh
```

#### For Alerts Only (Teams integration):
```bash

# Deploy everything
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### **Step 2: Configure Teams Integration**

```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  teams = "#alerts"
}
```

#### Option 2: Teams Power Automate (recommended for your case)
```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  teams_power_automate = "https://your-power-automate-url.com/alerts"
}
```

### **Step 3: Deploy and Test**
```bash
# Validate configuration
./scripts/validate.sh

# Deploy your chosen option
./scripts/deploy-dashboards.sh  # or deploy-alerts.sh or deploy.sh

# Test Teams notifications (if deploying alerts)
```

## üîß Teams Power Automate Setup

2. Create new flow
3. Add trigger: "When an HTTP request is received"
4. Add action: "Post a message in a chat or channel"
5. Configure Teams channel
6. Save and get the HTTP request URL

### **2. Configure in terraform.tfvars**
```hcl
notification_channels = {
  email = ["admin@company.com", "ops@company.com"]
  teams_power_automate = "https://your-power-automate-url.com/alerts"
}
```

### **3. Deploy with Teams Integration**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-alerts.sh
